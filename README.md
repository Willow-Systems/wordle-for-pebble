Red Funnel Pebble Map
=========

[Full writeup](https://willmurphy.co.uk/red-funnel-for-pebble/)

Red Funnel is a ferry company in the UK operating ferries to and from the Isle of Wight. The other day I noticed this cool realtime map on their site:

So naturally I rebuilt it for Pebble

Use Up + Down to cycle through ships and see their status. 

When the selected ship changes state the watch will vibrate. Pressing select triggers the backlight for a few seconds.
